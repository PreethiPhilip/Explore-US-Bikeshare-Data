# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

### Project Overview:
In this project, we will utilize Python and descriptive statistics to explore data from bike share systems in three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

Using Python, we will answer some interesting basic statistical questions about the data.I will also write a script that takes raw input to create an interactive terminal experience for presenting these statistics.

### Bike Share Details:
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have become increasingly numerous and popular in cities worldwide. These systems enable users to rent bicycles for short-term use at a cost, allowing them to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, or even return it to the same location if they just want to go for a ride. 
Consequently, each bike can serve multiple users per day.
Datasets include core columns: Start Time, End Time, Trip Duration, Start Station, End Station, User Type. (Additional columns for Chicago and NYC: Gender, Birth Year)
### Statistics Computed:
#### Popular Times of Travel:
* Most common month
* Most common day of the week
* Most common hour of the day
#### Popular Stations and Trips:
* Most common start station
* Most common end station
* Most common trip from start to end
#### Trip Duration:
* Total travel time
* Average travel time
#### User Info:
* Counts of each user type
* Counts of each gender (NYC and Chicago only)
* Earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth (NYC and Chicago only)
